# @mikker/input

**[DEMO and usage](https://mikker.github.io/input/demo/)**

A `.input` class for use with [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io).

Even though Tachyons' strictly functional style is great I always find myself re-adding some kind of base input to every project. This is it.

**NB: Be sure to include `input.css` _before_ `tachyons.css.**
